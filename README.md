This is the course project of Team 10 for Practical Data Science

The source code include two parts: clean1.py and model.py

clean1.py is used to clean the raw data found on the internet, while model.py is used to process and model the cleaned data
visual.py is for plotting the result

The source data files are the ones of csv format. I apologize for initially uploading some data files without including the extention.
